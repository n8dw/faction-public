# How to turn requests ON or OFF
Within the Glitch editor, you can manually turn requests ON and OFF. [Back to Help.](/admin/help/){.md-inline-url}

1. **In the files pane at the left,** select the `.env` file.

2. Inside it, note four fields of text. At the left side, two fields of **bolded** text. On the right, two fields of normal text.

3. In the right hand field next to **`REQUESTS_TOGGLE`**, remove the `on` text and type `off` to disable requests. 

4. To turn requests back on, remove the `off` text and replace it with `on`.

When you change Requests settings, your FACTION party will restart. This **shouldn't** affect music playback and can be done at any time.
